Shufflenet-v2-Pytorch 
Introduction

This is a Pytorch implementation of faceplusplus's ShuffleNet-v2. For details, please read the following papers: 
	ShuffleNet V2: Practical Guidelines for Efficient CNN Architecture Design

Pretrained Models on ImageNet

We provide pretrained ShuffleNet-v2 models on ImageNet, which achieve nearly accuracy with the original ones reported in the paper.

The top-1/5 accuracy rates by using single center crop (crop size: 224x224, image size: 256xN): 
Network 		Top-1 	Top-5	Top-1(reported in the paper) 
ShuffleNet-v2 		69.390 	88.412	69.400

Evaluate Models
